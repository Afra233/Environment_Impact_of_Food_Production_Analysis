## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to an engaging exploration of the **Environmental Impacts of Food Production**! Our mission is to uncover critical insights into sustainability by analyzing essential metrics such as land use, water consumption, and carbon footprints using robust analytical methods. By applying the **CRISP-DM framework**, we provide clear, actionable insights aimed at fostering sustainable practices in food production.

Let's shape a sustainable future, one bite at a time! 🌱
