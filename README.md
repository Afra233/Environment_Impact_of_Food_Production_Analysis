# Food Production and Environmental Impact Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the environmental impacts of food production using a dataset that includes information on land use, water consumption, carbon footprints, and other sustainability metrics. The analysis will follow the CRISP-DM framework and provide actionable insights to address sustainability challenges in food production.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, objectives, methodology, and data.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `scripts/`: Code files for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `visualizations/`: Graphs, charts, and dashboards used to communicate insights.
- `presentation/`: Summary of findings, business questions, and recommendations.

## Tools Used
The following tools were selected for data analysis and visualization:
- **Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)**: Used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code execution and documentation.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **VS Code**: Main development environment for writing and executing scripts.

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes 43 common food products and 23 variables related to their environmental impact. Key attributes:
- Greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product across different stages (land use change, animal feed, farm, processing, transport, packaging, retail).
- Water usage and eutrophication impact from agricultural runoff.

## CRISP-DM Framework Implementation
1. **Business Understanding**
   - Define sustainability challenges in food production.
   - Develop 7+ analytical questions.

2. **Data Understanding**
   - Explore dataset attributes, missing values, and distributions.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Clean and preprocess data for analysis.

4. **Modeling & Analysis**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Generate visualizations to derive insights.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Assess findings and answer business questions.

6. **Deployment & Documentation**
   - Summarize insights in a presentation.
   - Maintain an updated README with project progress.

## Final Deliverables
- **Visualization File/Link**: Dashboards and visual representations of key insights.
- **Documentation**: Detailed README with methodology and results.
- **Code & Scripts**: All Python scripts used in analysis.
- **Presentation**: Business questions, insights, and recommendations.
